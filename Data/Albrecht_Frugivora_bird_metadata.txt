Description:Compiling data from 1924 to 2023, Beth Gerstner, Pheobe Zarnetske and Patrick Bill sought to create a robust dataset which would allow for the quantifying of functional diversity within ecosystems. Frugivoria is a trait database, recording information on “dietary, life-history, morphological, and geographic traits” of frugivorous birds and mammals in Central and South America.  Frugivoria serves as a resource to make research involving these species more accessible. 

This file represents one of many tables that combine to make the database. This table is the full bird trait database which accounts for all variables collected

----------Key-------------

diet_cat_e - overall diet categorization obtained from percent prevalence foraging data 
min_body_size_mm - minimum body length
max_body_size_mm - maximum body length 
body_size_mm - body length from snout to anus (male measurements when available)

generation_time	- average age of the parents of the newest generation 
IUCN_category - International Union for Conservation of Nature (the following rankings in this dataset are - Critically endangered (CR), data deficient (DD), endangered (EN), least concern (LC), near threatened (NT), vulnerable (V). 



Clean up steps 
- Make a copy of the original data set. 
- Data validation isn't needed, having been done by Gerstner et al. 
- none of the column headings need to be changed nor do any of the entered observations.
- There are 56 columns in the original dataset. Much of that isn't relevant to my analysis so I will be deleting said irrelevant data. All columns from the original data set that are not designated on the key have been deleted.
