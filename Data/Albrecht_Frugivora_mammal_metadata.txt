Description: Compiling data from 1924 to 2023, Beth Gerstner, Pheobe Zarnetske and Patrick Bill sought to create a robust dataset which would allow for the quantifying of functional diversity within ecosystems. Frugivoria is a trait database, recording information on “dietary, life-history, morphological, and geographic traits” of frugivorous birds and mammals in Central and South America.  Frugivoria serves as a resource to make research involving these species more accessible. 

This file represents the simplified mammal database table within the broader database. Its simplification is the elimination of any traits that are not shared with birds.

----------Key-------------
IUCN_species_name - Full species name
common_name - species common name
genus - species genus
species - species name 
subspecies - subspecies name if applicable 
diet_cat_e - overall diet categorization obtained from percent prevalence foraging data 
diet_breadth - the total amount of types of organisms that the species consumes. The Shannon diversity index is applied to take into account the abundances of these different food sources  
IUCN_category - International Union for Conservation of Nature (the following rankings in this dataset are - Critically endangered (CR), data deficient (DD), endangered (EN), least concern (LC), near threatened (NT), vulnerable (V). 
mean_human_fp_range_2010 - weighted sum of human disturbance based on population density, infrastructure, and electricity use for the year of 2010
mean_human_fp_range_2020 - weighted sum of human disturbance based on population density, infrastructure, and electricity use for the year of 2020
percent_change_hf_2010_2020 - difference in mean human footprint between 2010 and 2020


Clean up steps 
- Make a copy of the original data set. 
- Data validation isn't needed, having been done by Gerstner et al.
- none of the column headings need to be changed nor do any of the entered observations. 
- There are 54 columns in the original dataset. Much of that isn't relevant to my analysis so I will be deleting said irrelevant data. All columns from the original data set that are not designated on the key have been deleted.
